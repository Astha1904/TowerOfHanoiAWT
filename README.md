## 📌 Project Description

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes.  
The objective is to move all disks from the first rod to the third rod following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. Only the top disk of any rod can be moved.

This application allows the user to:
- Enter the number of disks
- View the initial configuration
- Automatically solve the puzzle using a recursive algorithm
- Watch the solution through animated disk movements
