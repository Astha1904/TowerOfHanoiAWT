# Tower of Hanoi – Java AWT

A **Tower of Hanoi visualization application** developed using **Core Java and AWT**.  
This project demonstrates **recursion**, **animation**, and **object-oriented programming** concepts in a simple graphical interface.

## 📌 Project Description

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes.  
The objective is to move all disks from the first rod to the third rod following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. Only the top disk of any rod can be moved.

This application allows the user to:
- Enter the number of disks
- View the initial configuration
- Automatically solve the puzzle using a recursive algorithm
- Watch the solution through animated disk movements

## ✨ Features

- User-defined number of disks
- Recursive solution implementation
- Animated disk movements
- Real-time move counter
- No upper limit on disk count (practically limited by system performance)
- Built using **pure Java AWT**
- Simple and clean UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java)
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
- Recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
